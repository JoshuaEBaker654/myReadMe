## About me
Hi, my name is Joshua Baker. I am a Computer Science major, and I am super interested in learning more about developing software. I love to code and to problem solve. I love learning new things about what it means to be a developer. 

## Projects and Hobbies / interests
The bulk of the projects that I have done have been through Course work. I did have to make a RPG game at one point and kept working on it in my spare time just as a way to practice after the class was finished. Right now I am in the process of trying to come up with a project idea that I can work on in my own time on the side. The main idea that I have right now is to create a password generator. Some hobbies that I have include running, biking, gym, video games, kayaking, and coding. Out of all of the hobbies that I included I think running is my favorite. Running helps me clear my mind and most importantly gets me outside.
